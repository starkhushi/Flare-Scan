# **Flare Scan**
Welcome to the Early Forest Fire Prediction project! This repository houses the groundbreaking initiative aimed at leveraging IoT and AI technologies to safeguard our forests from devastating wildfires.

### Abstract
The Early Forest Fire Prediction project is a comprehensive system designed to predict and confirm forest fires in their early stages, enabling swift response from forest management authorities. Utilizing a combination of IoT sensors, machine learning algorithms, and real-time communication modules, our solution aims to revolutionize wildfire prevention and forest preservation efforts.

### Problems we faced:
- From 2001 to 2022, India lost 3.59 lakh hectares of tree cover from fires and 2.15 million hectares from all other drivers of loss.
- The annual loss from forest fires in India is estimated to be around 440 crore rupees (about $107 million). This estimate does not include biodiversity loss, nutrient loss, soil moisture loss, and other intangible benefits.
- According to the forest inventory records, 54.40% of forests in India are exposed to occasional fires, 7.49% to moderately frequent fires, and 2.40% to high incidence levels.

### Previous research and Existing solution:
- **Satellite-Based Monitoring Systems**: Utilizing satellite imagery systems like MODIS and AVHRR for forest fire detection, but limited by low resolution and long scan periods.
- **Camera-Based Systems**: Implementing multi-sensor wireless networks with IP cameras for fire detection, requiring line-of-sight communication and elevated camera placement.
- **LIDAR Technology**: Employing Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) for fire detection by measuring laser light backscattered by smoke particles, yet facing limitations such as high false alert rates due to climatic conditions.
- **Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)**: Developing systems based on WSN for forest fire identification, predominantly relying on temperature and humidity parameters, but overlooking other influential factors like wind.

### Workflow:
- IoT sensors gather environmental data and transmit it to Firebase via WiFi.
- ML model analyzes the data to predict the likelihood of a fire outbreak.
- Upon detection of a potential threat, the system activates the camera to capture images.
- Images are processed using YOLOv5 for confirmation of fire presence.
- Instant alerts are dispatched to the forest department, along with the precise fire location relayed through the GSM module.

## Working
Introducing "Early Forest Fire Prediction" – a groundbreaking project leveraging IoT and AI technologies to safeguard our forests. Our smart sensor box, equipped with temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed sensors, transmits real-time data via WiFi to Firebase. The data is seamlessly integrated into our SVM-based ML model, predicting the likelihood of a fire outbreak. Upon detecting a potential threat, our system activates a camera capturing images, processed by YOLOv5 through HTTP, confirming the presence of fire.
In the event of a confirmed fire, instant alerts are dispatched to the forest department, ensuring swift response. Simultaneously, our GSM module relays the precise fire location, expediting the rescue efforts. This comprehensive solution not only facilitates early detection but also employs cutting-edge technologies like OpenCV and YOLOv5 for rapid and accurate fire confirmation. A fusion of environmental monitoring, machine learning, and real-time communication, our system is a vital step towards proactive forest preservation. Join us in revolutionizing wildfire prevention for a greener future.
